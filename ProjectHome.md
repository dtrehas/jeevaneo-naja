Naja aims at simplifying the job of a small-technical-project manager handling tasks to be done, dispatching them among developpers ("resources").

Naja is an eclipse-based application, and can be used both as a standalone application, as a set of plugins integrated into Eclipse IDE or embedded into an more complex application.

Naja is a very young project - only a few hours of dev at the time being (feb 2009).
